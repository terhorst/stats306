The Pew Research Center uses respondents’ self-reported zip code as the basis for geographic variables such as region,state and county. 
We continue to include the original sample geographic variables in the datasets (these variables are preceded by an ‘s’)
for archival purposes only.

To protect the privacy of respondents, telephone numbers, zip code and other identifying variables have been removed from
the public data file.

Some special technical variables were also removed, but are available upon request.
